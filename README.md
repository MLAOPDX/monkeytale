# MonkeyTale

> "The book is a program." --- [Pollen](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/big-picture.html) by Matthew Butterick

MonkeyTale is an OPML markdown language for documenting and composing a story world and its novels. It adds some syntax rules on top of [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com)'s OPML extract. From that it tries to create the machine-readable world and manuscript structures from which plugins can create output. These plugins can generate Word documents for editor submissions or scene flows, or whatever else someone comes up with. They can even augment the structure.

For more details have a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/MLAOPDX/monkeytale/wiki).

## Development

I am building MonkeyTale to improve insight into my own writing and to learn more about software development.

MonkeyTale is developed in my spare time and uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and [Semantic Release](https://pypi.org/project/python-semantic-release/) to track its, equally spare, progress.

As per Semantic Versioning: "Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable."

Check the [change log](https://github.com/MLAOPDX/monkeytale/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for the latest updates.
